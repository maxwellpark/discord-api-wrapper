## Discord Automation Utilities (DAU)

A collection of python scripts for automating Discord guild services 

The folder structure is organised by type of utility (e.g. bot, webhook, etc.) 

This repo is designed to be modular, reusable, and generalisable to different contexts. Users should be able to easily automate tasks regardless of the type of server they are using.

Currently, the required dependencies are: 
# Discord
# Requests 
# BeautifulSoup 

Happy automating!
